GPU Ocean is a GPU-accelerated framework for running large ensembles of simplified ocean models for probabilistic drift trajectory forecasting. The ocean model is based on the shallow-water equations in a rotating frame of reference, and hence describes the barotropic dynamics of the ocean. This mathematical model is very well-suited for implementation on GPU, which enables efficient simulations and a well-suited model for investigating in ensemble-based probabilistic forecasting. It supports nesting within the results of operational 3D ocean models. This means that it uses the operational model for initial and boundary conditions, terrain data (bathymetry and coast line), and wind forcing, and online simulation of drift trajectories. Furthermore, the framework contains implementations of several ensemble-based data assimilation methods for efficient assimilation of point-based observations of ocean currents.
